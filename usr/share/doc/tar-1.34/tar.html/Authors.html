<h3 class="section" id="GNU-tar-Authors">1.5 <abbr class="acronym">GNU</abbr> <code class="command">tar</code> Authors</h3>

<p><abbr class="acronym">GNU</abbr> <code class="command">tar</code> was originally written by John Gilmore,
and modified by many people.  The <abbr class="acronym">GNU</abbr> enhancements were
written by Jay Fenlason, then Joy Kendall, and the whole package has
been further maintained by Thomas Bushnell, n/BSG, Fran&ccedil;ois
Pinard, Paul Eggert, and finally Sergey Poznyakoff with the help of
numerous and kind users.
</p>
<p>We wish to stress that <code class="command">tar</code> is a collective work, and owes much to
all those people who reported problems, offered solutions and other
insights, or shared their thoughts and suggestions.  An impressive, yet
partial list of those contributors can be found in the <samp class="file">THANKS</samp>
file from the <abbr class="acronym">GNU</abbr> <code class="command">tar</code> distribution.
</p>




<p>Jay Fenlason put together a draft of a <abbr class="acronym">GNU</abbr> <code class="command">tar</code>
manual, borrowing notes from the original man page from John Gilmore.
This was withdrawn in version 1.11.  Thomas Bushnell, n/BSG and Amy
Gorin worked on a tutorial and manual for <abbr class="acronym">GNU</abbr> <code class="command">tar</code>.
Fran&ccedil;ois Pinard put version 1.11.8 of the manual together by
taking information from all these sources and merging them.  Melissa
Weisshaus finally edited and redesigned the book to create version
1.12.  The book for versions from 1.14 up to 1.34 were edited
by the current maintainer, Sergey Poznyakoff.
</p>
<p>For version 1.12, Daniel Hagerty contributed a great deal of technical
consulting.  In particular, he is the primary author of <a class="ref" href="Backups.html">Performing Backups and Restoring Files</a>.
</p>
<p>In July, 2003 <abbr class="acronym">GNU</abbr> <code class="command">tar</code> was put on CVS at savannah.gnu.org
(see <a class="url" href="http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/tar">http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/tar</a>), and
active development and maintenance work has started
again.  Currently <abbr class="acronym">GNU</abbr> <code class="command">tar</code> is being maintained by Paul Eggert, Sergey
Poznyakoff and Jeff Bailey.
</p>
<p>Support for <abbr class="acronym">POSIX</abbr> archives was added by Sergey Poznyakoff.
