<h4 class="subsection" id="Checksumming-Problems">8.3.8 Checksumming Problems</h4>

<p>SunOS and HP-UX <code class="command">tar</code> fail to accept archives created using
<abbr class="acronym">GNU</abbr> <code class="command">tar</code> and containing non-<abbr class="acronym">ASCII</abbr> file names, that
is, file names having characters with the eighth bit set, because they
use signed checksums, while <abbr class="acronym">GNU</abbr> <code class="command">tar</code> uses unsigned
checksums while creating archives, as per <abbr class="acronym">POSIX</abbr> standards.  On
reading, <abbr class="acronym">GNU</abbr> <code class="command">tar</code> computes both checksums and accepts either of them.
It is somewhat worrying that a lot of people may go
around doing backup of their files using faulty (or at least
non-standard) software, not learning about it until it&rsquo;s time to
restore their missing files with an incompatible file extractor, or
vice versa.
</p>
<p><abbr class="acronym">GNU</abbr> <code class="command">tar</code> computes checksums both ways, and accepts either of them
on read, so <abbr class="acronym">GNU</abbr> tar can read Sun tapes even with their
wrong checksums.  <abbr class="acronym">GNU</abbr> <code class="command">tar</code> produces the standard
checksum, however, raising incompatibilities with Sun.  That is to
say, <abbr class="acronym">GNU</abbr> <code class="command">tar</code> has not been modified to
<em class="emph">produce</em> incorrect archives to be read by buggy <code class="command">tar</code>&rsquo;s.
I&rsquo;ve been told that more recent Sun <code class="command">tar</code> now read standard
archives, so maybe Sun did a similar patch, after all?
</p>
<p>The story seems to be that when Sun first imported <code class="command">tar</code>
sources on their system, they recompiled it without realizing that
the checksums were computed differently, because of a change in
the default signing of <code class="code">char</code>&rsquo;s in their compiler.  So they
started computing checksums wrongly.  When they later realized their
mistake, they merely decided to stay compatible with it, and with
themselves afterwards.  Presumably, but I do not really know, HP-UX
has chosen their <code class="command">tar</code> archives to be compatible with Sun&rsquo;s.
The current standards do not favor Sun <code class="command">tar</code> format.  In any
case, it now falls on the shoulders of SunOS and HP-UX users to get
a <code class="command">tar</code> able to read the good archives they receive.
