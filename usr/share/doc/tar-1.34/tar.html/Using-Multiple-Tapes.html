<h3 class="section" id="Using-Multiple-Tapes-1">9.6 Using Multiple Tapes</h3>

<p>Often you might want to write a large archive, one larger than will fit
on the actual tape you are using.  In such a case, you can run multiple
<code class="command">tar</code> commands, but this can be inconvenient, particularly if you
are using options like <samp class="option">--exclude=<var class="var">pattern</var></samp> or dumping entire file systems.
Therefore, <code class="command">tar</code> provides a special mode for creating
multi-volume archives.
</p>
<p><em class="dfn">Multi-volume</em> archive is a single <code class="command">tar</code> archive, stored
on several media volumes of fixed size.  Although in this section we will
often call &lsquo;<samp class="samp">volume</samp>&rsquo; a <em class="dfn">tape</em>, there is absolutely no
requirement for multi-volume archives to be stored on tapes.  Instead,
they can use whatever media type the user finds convenient, they can
even be located on files.
</p>
<p>When creating a multi-volume archive, <abbr class="acronym">GNU</abbr> <code class="command">tar</code> continues to fill
current volume until it runs out of space, then it switches to
next volume (usually the operator is queried to replace the tape on
this point), and continues working on the new volume.  This operation
continues until all requested files are dumped.  If <abbr class="acronym">GNU</abbr> <code class="command">tar</code> detects
end of media while dumping a file, such a file is archived in split
form.  Some very big files can even be split across several volumes.
</p>
<p>Each volume is itself a valid <abbr class="acronym">GNU</abbr> <code class="command">tar</code> archive, so it can be read
without any special options.  Consequently any file member residing
entirely on one volume can be extracted or otherwise operated upon
without needing the other volume.  Sure enough, to extract a split
member you would need all volumes its parts reside on.
</p>
<p>Multi-volume archives suffer from several limitations.  In particular,
they cannot be compressed.
</p>
<p><abbr class="acronym">GNU</abbr> <code class="command">tar</code> is able to create multi-volume archives of two formats
(see <a class="pxref" href="Formats.html">Controlling the Archive Format</a>): &lsquo;<samp class="samp">GNU</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp class="samp">POSIX</samp>&rsquo;.
