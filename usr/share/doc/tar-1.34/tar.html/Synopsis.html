<h3 class="section" id="General-Synopsis-of-tar">3.1 General Synopsis of <code class="command">tar</code></h3>

<p>The <abbr class="acronym">GNU</abbr> <code class="command">tar</code> program is invoked as either one of:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted"><kbd class="kbd">tar <var class="var">option</var>&hellip; [<var class="var">name</var>]&hellip;</kbd>
<kbd class="kbd">tar <var class="var">letter</var>&hellip; [<var class="var">argument</var>]&hellip; [<var class="var">option</var>]&hellip; [<var class="var">name</var>]&hellip;</kbd>
</pre></div>

<p>The second form is for when old options are being used.
</p>
<p>You can use <code class="command">tar</code> to store files in an archive, to extract them from
an archive, and to do other types of archive manipulation.  The primary
argument to <code class="command">tar</code>, which is called the <em class="dfn">operation</em>, specifies
which action to take.  The other arguments to <code class="command">tar</code> are either
<em class="dfn">options</em>, which change the way <code class="command">tar</code> performs an operation,
or file names or archive members, which specify the files or members
<code class="command">tar</code> is to act on.
</p>
<p>You can actually type in arguments in any order, even if in this manual
the options always precede the other arguments, to make examples easier
to understand.  Further, the option stating the main operation mode
(the <code class="command">tar</code> main command) is usually given first.
</p>
<p>Each <var class="var">name</var> in the synopsis above is interpreted as an archive member
name when the main command is one of <samp class="option">--compare</samp>
(<samp class="option">--diff</samp>, <samp class="option">-d</samp>), <samp class="option">--delete</samp>, <samp class="option">--extract</samp>
(<samp class="option">--get</samp>, <samp class="option">-x</samp>), <samp class="option">--list</samp> (<samp class="option">-t</samp>) or
<samp class="option">--update</samp> (<samp class="option">-u</samp>).  When naming archive members, you
must give the exact name of the member in the archive, as it is
printed by <samp class="option">--list</samp>.  For <samp class="option">--append</samp> (<samp class="option">-r</samp>) and
<samp class="option">--create</samp> (<samp class="option">-c</samp>), these <var class="var">name</var> arguments specify
the names of either files or directory hierarchies to place in the archive.
These files or hierarchies should already exist in the file system,
prior to the execution of the <code class="command">tar</code> command.
</p>
<p><code class="command">tar</code> interprets relative file names as being relative to the
working directory.  <code class="command">tar</code> will make all file names relative
(by removing leading slashes when archiving or restoring files),
unless you specify otherwise (using the <samp class="option">--absolute-names</samp>
option).  See <a class="xref" href="absolute.html">Absolute File Names</a>, for more information about
<samp class="option">--absolute-names</samp>.
</p>
<p>If you give the name of a directory as either a file name or a member
name, then <code class="command">tar</code> acts recursively on all the files and directories
beneath that directory.  For example, the name <samp class="file">/</samp> identifies all
the files in the file system to <code class="command">tar</code>.
</p>
<p>The distinction between file names and archive member names is especially
important when shell globbing is used, and sometimes a source of confusion
for newcomers.  See <a class="xref" href="wildcards.html">Wildcards Patterns and Matching</a>, for more information about globbing.
The problem is that shells may only glob using existing files in the
file system.  Only <code class="command">tar</code> itself may glob on archive members, so when
needed, you must ensure that wildcard characters reach <code class="command">tar</code> without
being interpreted by the shell first.  Using a backslash before &lsquo;<samp class="samp">*</samp>&rsquo;
or &lsquo;<samp class="samp">?</samp>&rsquo;, or putting the whole argument between quotes, is usually
sufficient for this.
</p>
<p>Even if <var class="var">name</var>s are often specified on the command line, they
can also be read from a text file in the file system, using the
<samp class="option">--files-from=<var class="var">file-of-names</var></samp> (<samp class="option">-T <var class="var">file-of-names</var></samp>) option.
</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t use any file name arguments, <samp class="option">--append</samp> (<samp class="option">-r</samp>),
<samp class="option">--delete</samp> and <samp class="option">--concatenate</samp> (<samp class="option">--catenate</samp>,
<samp class="option">-A</samp>) will do nothing, while <samp class="option">--create</samp> (<samp class="option">-c</samp>)
will usually yield a diagnostic and inhibit <code class="command">tar</code> execution.
The other operations of <code class="command">tar</code> (<samp class="option">--list</samp>,
<samp class="option">--extract</samp>, <samp class="option">--compare</samp>, and <samp class="option">--update</samp>)
will act on the entire contents of the archive.

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-return-status"></a>
<p>Besides successful exits, <abbr class="acronym">GNU</abbr> <code class="command">tar</code> may fail for
many reasons.  Some reasons correspond to bad usage, that is, when the
<code class="command">tar</code> command line is improperly written.  Errors may be
encountered later, while processing the archive or the files.  Some
errors are recoverable, in which case the failure is delayed until
<code class="command">tar</code> has completed all its work.  Some errors are such that
it would be not meaningful, or at least risky, to continue processing:
<code class="command">tar</code> then aborts processing immediately.  All abnormal exits,
whether immediate or delayed, should always be clearly diagnosed on
<code class="code">stderr</code>, after a line stating the nature of the error.
</p>
<p>Possible exit codes of <abbr class="acronym">GNU</abbr> <code class="command">tar</code> are summarized in the following
table:
</p>
<dl class="table">
<dt>0</dt>
<dd><p>&lsquo;<samp class="samp">Successful termination</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>1</dt>
<dd><p>&lsquo;<samp class="samp">Some files differ</samp>&rsquo;.  If tar was invoked with <samp class="option">--compare</samp>
(<samp class="option">--diff</samp>, <samp class="option">-d</samp>) command line option, this means that
some files in the archive differ from their disk counterparts
(see <a class="pxref" href="compare.html">Comparing Archive Members with the File System</a>).  If tar was given <samp class="option">--create</samp>,
<samp class="option">--append</samp> or <samp class="option">--update</samp> option, this exit code means
that some files were changed while being archived and so the resulting
archive does not contain the exact copy of the file set.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>2</dt>
<dd><p>&lsquo;<samp class="samp">Fatal error</samp>&rsquo;.  This means that some fatal, unrecoverable error
occurred.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>If <code class="command">tar</code> has invoked a subprocess and that subprocess exited with a
nonzero exit code, <code class="command">tar</code> exits with that code as well.
This can happen, for example, if <code class="command">tar</code> was given some
compression option (see <a class="pxref" href="gzip.html">Creating and Reading Compressed Archives</a>) and the external compressor program
failed.  Another example is <code class="command">rmt</code> failure during backup to the
remote device (see <a class="pxref" href="Remote-Tape-Server.html">Remote Tape Server</a>).
