<p>While an archive may contain many files, the archive itself is a
single ordinary file.  Like any other file, an archive file can be
written to a storage device such as a tape or disk, sent through a
pipe or over a network, saved on the active file system, or even
stored in another archive.  An archive file is not easy to read or
manipulate without using the <code class="command">tar</code> utility or Tar mode in
<abbr class="acronym">GNU</abbr> Emacs.
</p>
<p>Physically, an archive consists of a series of file entries terminated
by an end-of-archive entry, which consists of two 512 blocks of zero
bytes.  A file
entry usually describes one of the files in the archive (an
<em class="dfn">archive member</em>), and consists of a file header and the contents
of the file.  File headers contain file names and statistics, checksum
information which <code class="command">tar</code> uses to detect file corruption, and
information about file types.
</p>
<p>Archives are permitted to have more than one member with the same
member name.  One way this situation can occur is if more than one
version of a file has been stored in the archive.  For information
about adding new versions of a file to an archive, see <a class="ref" href="update.html">Updating an Archive</a>.
</p>
<p>In addition to entries describing archive members, an archive may
contain entries which <code class="command">tar</code> itself uses to store information.
See <a class="xref" href="label.html">Including a Label in the Archive</a>, for an example of such an archive entry.
</p>
<p>A <code class="command">tar</code> archive file contains a series of blocks.  Each block
contains <code class="code">BLOCKSIZE</code> bytes.  Although this format may be thought
of as being on magnetic tape, other media are often used.
</p>
<p>Each file archived is represented by a header block which describes
the file, followed by zero or more blocks which give the contents
of the file.  At the end of the archive file there are two 512-byte blocks
filled with binary zeros as an end-of-file marker.  A reasonable system
should write such end-of-file marker at the end of an archive, but
must not assume that such a block exists when reading an archive.  In
particular <abbr class="acronym">GNU</abbr> <code class="command">tar</code> always issues a warning if it does not encounter it.
</p>
<p>The blocks may be <em class="dfn">blocked</em> for physical I/O operations.
Each record of <var class="var">n</var> blocks (where <var class="var">n</var> is set by the
<samp class="option">--blocking-factor=<var class="var">512-size</var></samp> (<samp class="option">-b <var class="var">512-size</var></samp>) option to <code class="command">tar</code>) is written with a single
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">write&nbsp;()</samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w --> operation.  On magnetic tapes, the result of
such a write is a single record.  When writing an archive,
the last record of blocks should be written at the full size, with
blocks after the zero block containing all zeros.  When reading
an archive, a reasonable system should properly handle an archive
whose last record is shorter than the rest, or which contains garbage
records after a zero block.
</p>
<p>The header block is defined in C as follows.  In the <abbr class="acronym">GNU</abbr> <code class="command">tar</code>
distribution, this is part of file <samp class="file">src/tar.h</samp>:

<p>All characters in header blocks are represented by using 8-bit
characters in the local variant of ASCII.  Each field within the
structure is contiguous; that is, there is no padding used within
the structure.  Each character on the archive medium is stored
contiguously.
</p>
<p>Bytes representing the contents of files (after the header block
of each file) are not translated in any way and are not constrained
to represent characters in any character set.  The <code class="command">tar</code> format
does not distinguish text files from binary files, and no translation
of file contents is performed.
</p>
<p>The <code class="code">name</code>, <code class="code">linkname</code>, <code class="code">magic</code>, <code class="code">uname</code>, and
<code class="code">gname</code> are null-terminated character strings.  All other fields
are zero-filled octal numbers in ASCII.  Each numeric field of width
<var class="var">w</var> contains <var class="var">w</var> minus 1 digits, and a null.
(In the extended <abbr class="acronym">GNU</abbr> format, the numeric fields can take
other forms.)
</p>
<p>The <code class="code">name</code> field is the file name of the file, with directory names
(if any) preceding the file name, separated by slashes.
</p>


<p>The <code class="code">mode</code> field provides nine bits specifying file permissions
and three bits to specify the Set <abbr class="acronym">UID</abbr>, Set <abbr class="acronym">GID</abbr>, and Save Text
(<em class="dfn">sticky</em>) modes.  Values for these bits are defined above.
When special permissions are required to create a file with a given
mode, and the user restoring files from the archive does not hold such
permissions, the mode bit(s) specifying those special permissions
are ignored.  Modes which are not supported by the operating system
restoring files from the archive will be ignored.  Unsupported modes
should be faked up when creating or updating an archive; e.g., the
group permission could be copied from the <em class="emph">other</em> permission.
</p>
<p>The <code class="code">uid</code> and <code class="code">gid</code> fields are the numeric user and group
<abbr class="acronym">ID</abbr> of the file owners, respectively.  If the operating system does
not support numeric user or group <abbr class="acronym">ID</abbr>s, these fields should
be ignored.
</p>
<p>The <code class="code">size</code> field is the size of the file in bytes; linked files
are archived with this field specified as zero.
</p>
<p>The <code class="code">mtime</code> field represents the data modification time of the file at
the time it was archived.  It represents the integer number of
seconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00 Coordinated Universal Time.
</p>
<p>The <code class="code">chksum</code> field represents
the simple sum of all bytes in the header block.  Each 8-bit
byte in the header is added to an unsigned integer, initialized to
zero, the precision of which shall be no less than seventeen bits.
When calculating the checksum, the <code class="code">chksum</code> field is treated as
if it were all blanks.
</p>
<p>The <code class="code">typeflag</code> field specifies the type of file archived.  If a
particular implementation does not recognize or permit the specified
type, the file will be extracted as if it were a regular file.  As this
action occurs, <code class="command">tar</code> issues a warning to the standard error.
</p>
<p>The <code class="code">atime</code> and <code class="code">ctime</code> fields are used in making incremental
backups; they store, respectively, the particular file&rsquo;s access and
status change times.
</p>
<p>The <code class="code">offset</code> is used by the <samp class="option">--multi-volume</samp> (<samp class="option">-M</samp>) option, when
making a multi-volume archive.  The offset is number of bytes into
the file that we need to restart at to continue the file on the next
tape, i.e., where we store the location that a continued file is

<p>The following fields were added to deal with sparse files.  A file
is <em class="dfn">sparse</em> if it takes in unallocated blocks which end up being
represented as zeros, i.e., no useful data.  A test to see if a file
is sparse is to look at the number blocks allocated for it versus the
number of characters in the file; if there are fewer blocks allocated
for the file than would normally be allocated for a file of that
size, then the file is sparse.  This is the method <code class="command">tar</code> uses to
detect a sparse file, and once such a file is detected, it is treated
differently from non-sparse files.
</p>
<p>Sparse files are often <code class="code">dbm</code> files, or other database-type files
which have data at some points and emptiness in the greater part of
the file.  Such files can appear to be very large when an &lsquo;<samp class="samp">ls
-l</samp>&rsquo; is done on them, when in truth, there may be a very small amount
of important data contained in the file.  It is thus undesirable
to have <code class="command">tar</code> think that it must back up this entire file, as
great quantities of room are wasted on empty blocks, which can lead
to running out of room on a tape far earlier than is necessary.
Thus, sparse files are dealt with so that these empty blocks are
not written to the tape.  Instead, what is written to the tape is a
description, of sorts, of the sparse file: where the holes are, how
big the holes are, and how much data is found at the end of the hole.
This way, the file takes up potentially far less room on the tape,
and when the file is extracted later on, it will look exactly the way
it looked beforehand.  The following is a description of the fields
used to handle a sparse file:
</p>
<p>The <code class="code">sp</code> is an array of <code class="code">struct sparse</code>.  Each <code class="code">struct
sparse</code> contains two 12-character strings which represent an offset
into the file and a number of bytes to be written at that offset.
The offset is absolute, and not relative to the offset in preceding
array element.
</p>
<p>The header can hold four of these <code class="code">struct sparse</code> at the moment;
if more are needed, they are not stored in the header.
</p>
<p>The <code class="code">isextended</code> flag is set when an <code class="code">extended_header</code>
is needed to deal with a file.  Note that this means that this flag
can only be set when dealing with a sparse file, and it is only set
in the event that the description of the file will not fit in the
allotted room for sparse structures in the header.  In other words,
an extended_header is needed.
</p>
<p>The <code class="code">extended_header</code> structure is used for sparse files which
need more sparse structures than can fit in the header.  The header can
fit 4 such structures; if more are needed, the flag <code class="code">isextended</code>
gets set and the next block is an <code class="code">extended_header</code>.
</p>
<p>Each <code class="code">extended_header</code> structure contains an array of 21
sparse structures, along with a similar <code class="code">isextended</code> flag
that the header had.  There can be an indeterminate number of such
<code class="code">extended_header</code>s to describe a sparse file.
</p>
<dl class="table">
<dt><code class="code">REGTYPE</code></dt>
<dt><code class="code">AREGTYPE</code></dt>
<dd><p>These flags represent a regular file.  In order to be compatible
with older versions of <code class="command">tar</code>, a <code class="code">typeflag</code> value of
<code class="code">AREGTYPE</code> should be silently recognized as a regular file.
New archives should be created using <code class="code">REGTYPE</code>.  Also, for
backward compatibility, <code class="command">tar</code> treats a regular file whose name
ends with a slash as a directory.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code class="code">LNKTYPE</code></dt>
<dd><p>This flag represents a file linked to another file, of any type,
previously archived.  Such files are identified in Unix by each
file having the same device and inode number.  The linked-to name is
specified in the <code class="code">linkname</code> field with a trailing null.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code class="code">SYMTYPE</code></dt>
<dd><p>This represents a symbolic link to another file.  The linked-to name
is specified in the <code class="code">linkname</code> field with a trailing null.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code class="code">CHRTYPE</code></dt>
<dt><code class="code">BLKTYPE</code></dt>
<dd><p>These represent character special files and block special files
respectively.  In this case the <code class="code">devmajor</code> and <code class="code">devminor</code>
fields will contain the major and minor device numbers respectively.
Operating systems may map the device specifications to their own
local specification, or may ignore the entry.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code class="code">DIRTYPE</code></dt>
<dd><p>This flag specifies a directory or sub-directory.  The directory
name in the <code class="code">name</code> field should end with a slash.  On systems where
disk allocation is performed on a directory basis, the <code class="code">size</code> field
will contain the maximum number of bytes (which may be rounded to
the nearest disk block allocation unit) which the directory may
hold.  A <code class="code">size</code> field of zero indicates no such limiting.  Systems
which do not support limiting in this manner should ignore the
<code class="code">size</code> field.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code class="code">FIFOTYPE</code></dt>
<dd><p>This specifies a FIFO special file.  Note that the archiving of a
FIFO file archives the existence of this file and not its contents.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code class="code">CONTTYPE</code></dt>
<dd><p>This specifies a contiguous file, which is the same as a normal
file except that, in operating systems which support it, all its
space is allocated contiguously on the disk.  Operating systems
which do not allow contiguous allocation should silently treat this
type as a normal file.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code class="code">A</code> &hellip; <code class="code">Z</code></dt>
<dd><p>These are reserved for custom implementations.  Some of these are
used in the <abbr class="acronym">GNU</abbr> modified format, as described below.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Other values are reserved for specification in future revisions of
the P1003 standard, and should not be used by any <code class="command">tar</code> program.
</p>
<p>The <code class="code">magic</code> field indicates that this archive was output in
the P1003 archive format.  If this field contains <code class="code">TMAGIC</code>,
the <code class="code">uname</code> and <code class="code">gname</code> fields will contain the ASCII
representation of the owner and group of the file respectively.
If found, the user and group <abbr class="acronym">ID</abbr>s are used rather than the values in
the <code class="code">uid</code> and <code class="code">gid</code> fields.
