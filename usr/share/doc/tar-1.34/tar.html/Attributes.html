<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-attributes_002c-files"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-file-attributes"></a>

<p>When <code class="command">tar</code> reads files, it updates their access times.  To
avoid this, use the <samp class="option">--atime-preserve[=METHOD]</samp> option, which can either
reset the access time retroactively or avoid changing it in the first
place.
</p>
<dl class="table">
<dd><a class="index-entry-id" id="index-atime_002dpreserve"></a>
</dd>
<dt><samp class="option">--atime-preserve</samp></dt>
<dt><samp class="option">--atime-preserve=replace</samp></dt>
<dt><samp class="option">--atime-preserve=system</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Preserve the access times of files that are read.  This works only for
files that you own, unless you have superuser privileges.
</p>
<p><samp class="option">--atime-preserve=replace</samp> works on most systems, but it also
restores the data modification time and updates the status change
time.  Hence it doesn&rsquo;t interact with incremental dumps nicely
(see <a class="pxref" href="Incremental-Dumps.html">Using <code class="command">tar</code> to Perform Incremental Dumps</a>), and it can set access or data modification times
incorrectly if other programs access the file while <code class="command">tar</code> is
running.
</p>
<p><samp class="option">--atime-preserve=system</samp> avoids changing the access time in
the first place, if the operating system supports this.
Unfortunately, this may or may not work on any given operating system
or file system.  If <code class="command">tar</code> knows for sure it won&rsquo;t work, it
complains right away.
</p>
<p>Currently <samp class="option">--atime-preserve</samp> with no operand defaults to
<samp class="option">--atime-preserve=replace</samp>, but this is intended to change to
<samp class="option">--atime-preserve=system</samp> when the latter is better-supported.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-touch-1"></a>
</dd>
<dt><samp class="option">-m</samp></dt>
<dt><samp class="option">--touch</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Do not extract data modification time.
</p>
<p>When this option is used, <code class="command">tar</code> leaves the data modification times
of the files it extracts as the times when the files were extracted,
instead of setting it to the times recorded in the archive.
</p>
<p>This option is meaningless with <samp class="option">--list</samp> (<samp class="option">-t</samp>).
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-same_002downer"></a>
</dd>
<dt><samp class="option">--same-owner</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Create extracted files with the same ownership they have in the
archive.
</p>
<p>This is the default behavior for the superuser,
so this option is meaningful only for non-root users, when <code class="command">tar</code>
is executed on those systems able to give files away.  This is
considered as a security flaw by many people, at least because it
makes quite difficult to correctly account users for the disk space
they occupy.  Also, the <code class="code">suid</code> or <code class="code">sgid</code> attributes of
files are easily and silently lost when files are given away.
</p>
<p>When writing an archive, <code class="command">tar</code> writes the user <abbr class="acronym">ID</abbr> and user name
separately.  If it can&rsquo;t find a user name (because the user <abbr class="acronym">ID</abbr> is not
in <samp class="file">/etc/passwd</samp>), then it does not write one.  When restoring,
it tries to look the name (if one was written) up in
<samp class="file">/etc/passwd</samp>.  If it fails, then it uses the user <abbr class="acronym">ID</abbr> stored in
the archive instead.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-no_002dsame_002downer"></a>
</dd>
<dt><samp class="option">--no-same-owner</samp></dt>
<dt><samp class="option">-o</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Do not attempt to restore ownership when extracting.  This is the
default behavior for ordinary users, so this option has an effect
only for the superuser.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-numeric_002downer"></a>
</dd>
<dt><samp class="option">--numeric-owner</samp></dt>
<dd><p>The <samp class="option">--numeric-owner</samp> option allows (ANSI) archives to be written
without user/group name information or such information to be ignored
when extracting.  It effectively disables the generation and/or use
of user/group name information.  This option forces extraction using
the numeric ids from the archive, ignoring the names.
</p>
<p>This is useful in certain circumstances, when restoring a backup from
an emergency floppy with different passwd/group files for example.
It is otherwise impossible to extract files with the right ownerships
if the password file in use during the extraction does not match the
one belonging to the file system(s) being extracted.  This occurs,
for example, if you are restoring your files after a major crash and
had booted from an emergency floppy with no password file or put your
disk into another machine to do the restore.
</p>
<p>The numeric ids are <em class="emph">always</em> saved into <code class="command">tar</code> archives.
The identifying names are added at create time when provided by the
system, unless <samp class="option">--format=oldgnu</samp> is used.  Numeric ids could be
used when moving archives between a collection of machines using
a centralized management for attribution of numeric ids to users
and groups.  This is often made through using the NIS capabilities.
</p>
<p>When making a <code class="command">tar</code> file for distribution to other sites, it
is sometimes cleaner to use a single owner for all files in the
distribution, and nicer to specify the write permission bits of the
files as stored in the archive independently of their actual value on
the file system.  The way to prepare a clean distribution is usually
to have some Makefile rule creating a directory, copying all needed
files in that directory, then setting ownership and permissions as
wanted (there are a lot of possible schemes), and only then making a
<code class="command">tar</code> archive out of this directory, before cleaning
everything out.  Of course, we could add a lot of options to
<abbr class="acronym">GNU</abbr> <code class="command">tar</code> for fine tuning permissions and ownership.
This is not the good way, I think.  <abbr class="acronym">GNU</abbr> <code class="command">tar</code> is
already crowded with options and moreover, the approach just explained
gives you a great deal of control already.

<dt><samp class="option">--same-permissions</samp></dt>
<dt><samp class="option">--preserve-permissions</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Extract all protection information.
</p>
<p>This option causes <code class="command">tar</code> to set the modes (access permissions) of
extracted files exactly as recorded in the archive.  If this option
is not used, the current <code class="code">umask</code> setting limits the permissions
on extracted files.  This option is by default enabled when
<code class="command">tar</code> is executed by a superuser.
</p>

<p>This option is meaningless with <samp class="option">--list</samp> (<samp class="option">-t</samp>).
