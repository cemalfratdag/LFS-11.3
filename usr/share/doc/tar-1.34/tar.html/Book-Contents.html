<h3 class="section" id="What-this-Book-Contains">1.1 What this Book Contains</h3>

<p>The first part of this chapter introduces you to various terms that will
recur throughout the book.  It also tells you who has worked on <abbr class="acronym">GNU</abbr> <code class="command">tar</code>
and its documentation, and where you should send bug reports
or comments.
</p>
<p>The second chapter is a tutorial (see <a class="pxref" href="Tutorial.html">Tutorial Introduction to <code class="command">tar</code></a>) which provides a
gentle introduction for people who are new to using <code class="command">tar</code>.  It is
meant to be self-contained, not requiring any reading from subsequent
chapters to make sense.  It moves from topic to topic in a logical,
progressive order, building on information already explained.
</p>
<p>Although the tutorial is paced and structured to allow beginners to
learn how to use <code class="command">tar</code>, it is not intended solely for beginners.
The tutorial explains how to use the three most frequently used
operations (&lsquo;<samp class="samp">create</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">list</samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp class="samp">extract</samp>&rsquo;) as well as
two frequently used options (&lsquo;<samp class="samp">file</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp class="samp">verbose</samp>&rsquo;).  The other
chapters do not refer to the tutorial frequently; however, if a section
discusses something which is a complex variant of a basic concept, there
may be a cross-reference to that basic concept.  (The entire book,
including the tutorial, assumes that the reader understands some basic
concepts of using a Unix-type operating system; see <a class="pxref" href="Tutorial.html">Tutorial Introduction to <code class="command">tar</code></a>.)
</p>
<p>The third chapter presents the remaining five operations, and
information about using <code class="command">tar</code> options and option syntax.
</p>
<p>The other chapters are meant to be used as a reference.  Each chapter
presents everything that needs to be said about a specific topic.
</p>
<p>One of the chapters (see <a class="pxref" href="Date-input-formats.html">Date input formats</a>) exists in its
entirety in other <abbr class="acronym">GNU</abbr> manuals, and is mostly self-contained.
In addition, one section of this manual (see <a class="pxref" href="Standard.html">Basic Tar Format</a>) contains a
big quote which is taken directly from <code class="command">tar</code> sources.
</p>
<p>In general, we give both long and short (abbreviated) option names
at least once in each section where the relevant option is covered, so
that novice readers will become familiar with both styles.  (A few
options have no short versions, and the relevant sections will
indicate this.)
