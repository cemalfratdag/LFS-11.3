<h4 class="subsection" id="Preparing-a-Practice-Directory-for-Examples">2.6.1 Preparing a Practice Directory for Examples</h4>

<p>To follow along with this and future examples, create a new directory
called <samp class="file">practice</samp> containing files called <samp class="file">blues</samp>, <samp class="file">folk</samp>
and <samp class="file">jazz</samp>.  The files can contain any information you like:
ideally, they should contain information which relates to their names,
and be of different lengths.  Our examples assume that <samp class="file">practice</samp>
is a subdirectory of your home directory.
</p>
<p>Now <code class="command">cd</code> to the directory named <samp class="file">practice</samp>; <samp class="file">practice</samp>
is now your <em class="dfn">working directory</em>.  (<em class="emph">Please note</em>: Although
the full file name of this directory is
<samp class="file">/<var class="var">homedir</var>/practice</samp>, in our examples we will refer to
this directory as <samp class="file">practice</samp>; the <var class="var">homedir</var> is presumed.)
</p>
<p>In general, you should check that the files to be archived exist where
you think they do (in the working directory) by running <code class="command">ls</code>.
Because you just created the directory and the files and have changed to
that directory, you probably don&rsquo;t need to do that this time.
</p>
<p>It is very important to make sure there isn&rsquo;t already a file in the
working directory with the archive name you intend to use (in this case,
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">collection.tar</samp>&rsquo;), or that you don&rsquo;t care about its contents.
Whenever you use &lsquo;<samp class="samp">create</samp>&rsquo;, <code class="command">tar</code> will erase the current
contents of the file named by <samp class="option">--file=<var class="var">archive-name</var></samp> (<samp class="option">-f <var class="var">archive-name</var></samp>) if it exists.  <code class="command">tar</code>
will not tell you if you are about to overwrite an archive unless you
specify an option which does this (see <a class="pxref" href="backup.html">Backup options</a>, for the
information on how to do so).  To add files to an existing archive,
you need to use a different option, such as <samp class="option">--append</samp> (<samp class="option">-r</samp>); see
<a class="ref" href="append.html">How to Add Files to Existing Archives: <samp class="option">--append</samp></a> for information on how to do this.
