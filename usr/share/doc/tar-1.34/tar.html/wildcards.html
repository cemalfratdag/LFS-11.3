<h3 class="section" id="Wildcards-Patterns-and-Matching">6.5 Wildcards Patterns and Matching</h3>

<p><em class="dfn">Globbing</em> is the operation by which <em class="dfn">wildcard</em> characters,
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">*</samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp class="samp">?</samp>&rsquo; for example, are replaced and expanded into all
existing files matching the given pattern.  <abbr class="acronym">GNU</abbr> <code class="command">tar</code> can use wildcard
patterns for matching (or globbing) archive members when extracting
from or listing an archive.  Wildcard patterns are also used for
verifying volume labels of <code class="command">tar</code> archives.  This section has the
purpose of explaining wildcard syntax for <code class="command">tar</code>.
</p>


<p>A <var class="var">pattern</var> should be written according to shell syntax, using wildcard
characters to effect globbing.  Most characters in the pattern stand
for themselves in the matched string, and case is significant: &lsquo;<samp class="samp">a</samp>&rsquo;
will match only &lsquo;<samp class="samp">a</samp>&rsquo;, and not &lsquo;<samp class="samp">A</samp>&rsquo;.  The character &lsquo;<samp class="samp">?</samp>&rsquo; in the
pattern matches any single character in the matched string.  The character
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">*</samp>&rsquo; in the pattern matches zero, one, or more single characters in
the matched string.  The character &lsquo;<samp class="samp">\</samp>&rsquo; says to take the following
character of the pattern <em class="emph">literally</em>; it is useful when one needs to
match the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">?</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">*</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">[</samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp class="samp">\</samp>&rsquo; characters, themselves.
</p>
<p>The character &lsquo;<samp class="samp">[</samp>&rsquo;, up to the matching &lsquo;<samp class="samp">]</samp>&rsquo;, introduces a character
class.  A <em class="dfn">character class</em> is a list of acceptable characters
for the next single character of the matched string.  For example,
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">[abcde]</samp>&rsquo; would match any of the first five letters of the alphabet.
Note that within a character class, all of the &ldquo;special characters&rdquo;
listed above other than &lsquo;<samp class="samp">\</samp>&rsquo; lose their special meaning; for example,
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">[-\\[*?]]</samp>&rsquo; would match any of the characters, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">\</samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">[</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">*</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">?</samp>&rsquo;, or &lsquo;<samp class="samp">]</samp>&rsquo;.  (Due to parsing constraints,
the characters &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp class="samp">]</samp>&rsquo; must either come <em class="emph">first</em> or
<em class="emph">last</em> in a character class.)
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Excluding-characters-from-a-character-class"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Character-class_002c-excluding-characters-from"></a>
<p>If the first character of the class after the opening &lsquo;<samp class="samp">[</samp>&rsquo;
is &lsquo;<samp class="samp">!</samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp class="samp">^</samp>&rsquo;, then the meaning of the class is reversed.
Rather than listing character to match, it lists those characters which
are <em class="emph">forbidden</em> as the next single character of the matched string.
</p>
<p>Other characters of the class stand for themselves.  The special
construction &lsquo;<samp class="samp">[<var class="var">a</var>-<var class="var">e</var>]</samp>&rsquo;, using an hyphen between two
letters, is meant to represent all characters between <var class="var">a</var> and
<var class="var">e</var>, inclusive.
</p>


<p>Periods (&lsquo;<samp class="samp">.</samp>&rsquo;) or forward slashes (&lsquo;<samp class="samp">/</samp>&rsquo;) are not considered
special for wildcard matches.  However, if a pattern completely matches
a directory prefix of a matched string, then it matches the full matched
string: thus, excluding a directory also excludes all the files beneath it.
