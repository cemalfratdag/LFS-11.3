<h4 class="subsection" id="How-to-Extract-GNU_002dSpecific-Data-Using-Other-tar-Implementations">8.3.10 How to Extract GNU-Specific Data Using Other <code class="command">tar</code> Implementations</h4>

<p>In previous sections you became acquainted with various quirks
necessary to make your archives portable.  Sometimes you may need to
extract archives containing GNU-specific members using some
third-party <code class="command">tar</code> implementation or an older version of
<abbr class="acronym">GNU</abbr> <code class="command">tar</code>.  Of course your best bet is to have <abbr class="acronym">GNU</abbr> <code class="command">tar</code> installed,
but if it is for some reason impossible, this section will explain
how to cope without it.
</p>
<p>When we speak about <em class="dfn">GNU-specific</em> members we mean two classes of
them: members split between the volumes of a multi-volume archive and
sparse members.  You will be able to always recover such members if
the archive is in PAX format.  In addition split members can be
recovered from archives in old GNU format.  The following subsections
describe the required procedures in detail.
