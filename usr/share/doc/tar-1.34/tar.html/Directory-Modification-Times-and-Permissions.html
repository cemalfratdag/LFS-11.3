<h4 class="unnumberedsubsubsec" id="Directory-Modification-Times-and-Permissions-1">Directory Modification Times and Permissions</h4>

<p>After successfully extracting a file member, <abbr class="acronym">GNU</abbr> <code class="command">tar</code> normally
restores its permissions and modification times, as described in the
previous sections.  This cannot be done for directories, because
after extracting a directory <code class="command">tar</code> will almost certainly
extract files into that directory and this will cause the directory
modification time to be updated.  Moreover, restoring that directory
permissions may not permit file creation within it.  Thus, restoring
directory permissions and modification times must be delayed at least
until all files have been extracted into that directory.  <abbr class="acronym">GNU</abbr> <code class="command">tar</code>
restores directories using the following approach.
</p>
<p>The extracted directories are created with the mode specified in the
archive, as modified by the umask of the user, which gives sufficient
permissions to allow file creation.  The meta-information about the
directory is recorded in the temporary list of directories.  When
preparing to extract next archive member, <abbr class="acronym">GNU</abbr> <code class="command">tar</code> checks if the
directory prefix of this file contains the remembered directory.  If
it does not, the program assumes that all files have been extracted
into that directory, restores its modification time and permissions
and removes its entry from the internal list.  This approach allows
to correctly restore directory meta-information in the majority of
cases, while keeping memory requirements sufficiently small.  It is
based on the fact, that most <code class="command">tar</code> archives use the predefined
order of members: first the directory, then all the files and
subdirectories in that directory.
</p>
<p>However, this is not always true.  The most important exception are
incremental archives (see <a class="pxref" href="Incremental-Dumps.html">Using <code class="command">tar</code> to Perform Incremental Dumps</a>).  The member order in
an incremental archive is reversed: first all directory members are
stored, followed by other (non-directory) members.  So, when extracting
from incremental archives, <abbr class="acronym">GNU</abbr> <code class="command">tar</code> alters the above procedure.  It
remembers all restored directories, and restores their meta-data
only after the entire archive has been processed.  Notice, that you do
not need to specify any special options for that, as <abbr class="acronym">GNU</abbr> <code class="command">tar</code>
automatically detects archives in incremental format.
</p>
<p>There may be cases, when such processing is required for normal archives
too.  Consider the following example:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<div class="group"><pre class="example-preformatted">$ <kbd class="kbd">tar --no-recursion -cvf archive \
    foo foo/file1 bar bar/file foo/file2</kbd>
foo/
foo/file1
bar/
bar/file
foo/file2
</pre></div></div>

<p>During the normal operation, after encountering <samp class="file">bar</samp>
<abbr class="acronym">GNU</abbr> <code class="command">tar</code> will assume that all files from the directory <samp class="file">foo</samp>
were already extracted and will therefore restore its timestamp and
permission bits.  However, after extracting <samp class="file">foo/file2</samp> the
directory timestamp will be offset again.
</p>
<p>To correctly restore directory meta-information in such cases, use
the <samp class="option">--delay-directory-restore</samp> command line option:
</p>
<dl class="table">
<dd><a class="index-entry-id" id="index-delay_002ddirectory_002drestore"></a>
</dd>
<dt><samp class="option">--delay-directory-restore</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Delays restoring of the modification times and permissions of extracted
directories until the end of extraction.  This way, correct
meta-information is restored even if the archive has unusual member
ordering.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-no_002ddelay_002ddirectory_002drestore"></a>
</dd>
<dt><samp class="option">--no-delay-directory-restore</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Cancel the effect of the previous <samp class="option">--delay-directory-restore</samp>.
Use this option if you have used <samp class="option">--delay-directory-restore</samp> in
<code class="env">TAR_OPTIONS</code> variable (see <a class="pxref" href="using-tar-options.html#TAR_005fOPTIONS">TAR_OPTIONS</a>) and wish to
temporarily disable it.
