<p>Ideally, when <code class="command">tar</code> is creating an archive, it reads from a
file system that is not being modified, and encounters no errors or
inconsistencies while reading and writing.  If this is the case, the
archive should faithfully reflect what was read.  Similarly, when
extracting from an archive, ideally <code class="command">tar</code> ideally encounters
no errors and the extracted files faithfully reflect what was in the
archive.
</p>
<p>However, when reading or writing real-world file systems, several
things can go wrong; these include permissions problems, corruption of
data, and race conditions.
