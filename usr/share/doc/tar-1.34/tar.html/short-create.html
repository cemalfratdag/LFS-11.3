<h4 class="subsection" id="Short-Forms-with-create">2.6.4 Short Forms with &lsquo;<samp class="samp">create</samp>&rsquo;</h4>

<p>As we said before, the <samp class="option">--create</samp> (<samp class="option">-c</samp>) operation is one of the most
basic uses of <code class="command">tar</code>, and you will use it countless times.
Eventually, you will probably want to use abbreviated (or &ldquo;short&rdquo;)
forms of options.  A full discussion of the three different forms that
options can take appears in <a class="ref" href="Styles.html">The Three Option Styles</a>; for now, here is what the
previous example (including the <samp class="option">--verbose</samp> (<samp class="option">-v</samp>) option) looks like
using short option forms:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">$ <kbd class="kbd">tar -cvf collection.tar blues folk jazz</kbd>
blues
folk
jazz
</pre></div>

<p>As you can see, the system responds the same no matter whether you use
long or short option forms.
</p>
<p>One difference between using
short and long option forms is that, although the exact placement of
arguments following options is no more specific when using short forms,
it is easier to become confused and make a mistake when using short
forms.  For example, suppose you attempted the above example in the
following way:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">$ <kbd class="kbd">tar -cfv collection.tar blues folk jazz</kbd>
</pre></div>

<p>In this case, <code class="command">tar</code> will make an archive file called <samp class="file">v</samp>,
containing the files <samp class="file">blues</samp>, <samp class="file">folk</samp>, and <samp class="file">jazz</samp>, because
the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">v</samp>&rsquo; is the closest &ldquo;file name&rdquo; to the <samp class="option">-f</samp> option, and
is thus taken to be the chosen archive file name.  <code class="command">tar</code> will try
to add a file called <samp class="file">collection.tar</samp> to the <samp class="file">v</samp> archive file;
if the file <samp class="file">collection.tar</samp> did not already exist, <code class="command">tar</code> will
report an error indicating that this file does not exist.  If the file
<samp class="file">collection.tar</samp> does already exist (e.g., from a previous command
you may have run), then <code class="command">tar</code> will add this file to the archive.
Because the <samp class="option">-v</samp> option did not get registered, <code class="command">tar</code> will not
run under &lsquo;<samp class="samp">verbose</samp>&rsquo; mode, and will not report its progress.
</p>
<p>The end result is that you may be quite confused about what happened,
and possibly overwrite a file.  To illustrate this further, we will show
you how an example we showed previously would look using short forms.
</p>
<p>This example,
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">$ <kbd class="kbd">tar --create folk blues --file=collection.tar jazz</kbd>
</pre></div>

<p>is confusing as it is.  It becomes even more so when using short forms:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">$ <kbd class="kbd">tar -c folk blues -f collection.tar jazz</kbd>
</pre></div>

<p>It would be very easy to put the wrong string of characters
immediately following the <samp class="option">-f</samp>, but doing that could sacrifice
valuable data.
</p>
<p>For this reason, we recommend that you pay very careful attention to
the order of options and placement of file and archive names,
especially when using short option forms.  Not having the option name
written out mnemonically can affect how well you remember which option
does what, and therefore where different names have to be placed.
