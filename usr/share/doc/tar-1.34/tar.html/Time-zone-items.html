<h3 class="section" id="Time-zone-items-1">7.4 Time zone items</h3>

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-time-zone-item-1"></a>

<p>A <em class="dfn">time zone item</em> specifies an international time zone, indicated
by a small set of letters, e.g., &lsquo;<samp class="samp">UTC</samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp class="samp">Z</samp>&rsquo;
for Coordinated Universal
Time.  Any included periods are ignored.  By following a
non-daylight-saving time zone by the string &lsquo;<samp class="samp">DST</samp>&rsquo; in a separate
word (that is, separated by some white space), the corresponding
daylight saving time zone may be specified.
Alternatively, a non-daylight-saving time zone can be followed by a
time zone correction, to add the two values.  This is normally done
only for &lsquo;<samp class="samp">UTC</samp>&rsquo;; for example, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">UTC+05:30</samp>&rsquo; is equivalent to
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">+05:30</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>Time zone items other than &lsquo;<samp class="samp">UTC</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp class="samp">Z</samp>&rsquo;
are obsolescent and are not recommended, because they
are ambiguous; for example, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">EST</samp>&rsquo; has a different meaning in
Australia than in the United States, and &lsquo;<samp class="samp">A</samp>&rsquo; has different
meaning as a military time zone than as an obsolescent
RFC 822 time zone.  Instead, it&rsquo;s better to use
unambiguous numeric time zone corrections like &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-0500</samp>&rsquo;, as
described in the previous section.
</p>
<p>If neither a time zone item nor a time zone correction is supplied,
timestamps are interpreted using the rules of the default time zone
(see <a class="pxref" href="Specifying-time-zone-rules.html">Specifying time zone rules</a>).
