<p>If you precede a number with &lsquo;<samp class="samp">@</samp>&rsquo;, it represents an internal
timestamp as a count of seconds.  The number can contain an internal
decimal point (either &lsquo;<samp class="samp">.</samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp class="samp">,</samp>&rsquo;); any excess precision not
supported by the internal representation is truncated toward minus
infinity.  Such a number cannot be combined with any other date
item, as it specifies a complete timestamp.
</p>

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Epoch_002c-for-POSIX"></a>
<p>Internally, computer times are represented as a count of seconds since
an Epoch&mdash;a well-defined point of time.  On GNU and
POSIX systems, the Epoch is 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC, so
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">@0</samp>&rsquo; represents this time, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">@1</samp>&rsquo; represents 1970-01-01
00:00:01 UTC, and so forth.  GNU and most other
POSIX-compliant systems support such times as an extension
to POSIX, using negative counts, so that &lsquo;<samp class="samp">@-1</samp>&rsquo;
represents 1969-12-31 23:59:59 UTC.
</p>
<p>Most modern systems count seconds with 64-bit two&rsquo;s-complement integers
of seconds with nanosecond subcounts, which is a range that includes
the known lifetime of the universe with nanosecond resolution.
Some obsolescent systems count seconds with 32-bit two&rsquo;s-complement
integers and can represent times from 1901-12-13 20:45:52 through
2038-01-19 03:14:07 UTC.  A few systems sport other time ranges.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-leap-seconds-2"></a>
<p>On most hosts, these counts ignore the presence of leap seconds.
For example, on most hosts &lsquo;<samp class="samp">@1483228799</samp>&rsquo; represents 2016-12-31
23:59:59 UTC, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">@1483228800</samp>&rsquo; represents 2017-01-01 00:00:00
UTC, and there is no way to represent the intervening leap second
2016-12-31 23:59:60 UTC.
