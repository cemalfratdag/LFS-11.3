<h4 class="subsection" id="Extracting-Specific-Files">2.8.2 Extracting Specific Files</h4>

<p>To extract specific archive members, give their exact member names as
arguments, as printed by <samp class="option">--list</samp> (<samp class="option">-t</samp>).  If you had
mistakenly deleted one of the files you had placed in the archive
<samp class="file">collection.tar</samp> earlier (say, <samp class="file">blues</samp>), you can extract it
from the archive without changing the archive&rsquo;s structure.  Its
contents will be identical to the original file <samp class="file">blues</samp> that you
deleted.
</p>
<p>First, make sure you are in the <samp class="file">practice</samp> directory, and list the
files in the directory.  Now, delete the file, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">blues</samp>&rsquo;, and list
the files in the directory again.
</p>
<p>You can now extract the member <samp class="file">blues</samp> from the archive file
<samp class="file">collection.tar</samp> like this:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">$ <kbd class="kbd">tar --extract --file=collection.tar blues</kbd>
</pre></div>

<p>If you list the files in the directory again, you will see that the file
<samp class="file">blues</samp> has been restored, with its original permissions, data
modification times, and owner.<a class="footnote" id="DOCF1" href="#FOOT1"><sup>1</sup></a>  (These parameters will be identical to those which
the file had when you originally placed it in the archive; any changes
you may have made before deleting the file from the file system,
however, will <em class="emph">not</em> have been made to the archive member.)  The
archive file, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">collection.tar</samp>&rsquo;, is the same as it was before you
extracted &lsquo;<samp class="samp">blues</samp>&rsquo;.  You can confirm this by running <code class="command">tar</code> with
<samp class="option">--list</samp> (<samp class="option">-t</samp>).
</p>
<p>Remember that as with other operations, specifying the exact member
name is important (See <a class="xref" href="failing-commands.html">Commands That Will Fail</a>, for more examples).
</p>
<p>You can extract a file to standard output by combining the above options
with the <samp class="option">--to-stdout</samp> (<samp class="option">-O</samp>) option (see <a class="pxref" href="Writing-to-Standard-Output.html">Writing to Standard Output</a>).
</p>
<p>If you give the <samp class="option">--verbose</samp> option, then <samp class="option">--extract</samp>
will print the names of the archive members as it extracts them.

<p>This is only accidentally
true, but not in general.  Whereas modification times are always
restored, in most cases, one has to be root for restoring the owner,
and use a special option for restoring permissions.  Here, it just
happens that the restoring user is also the owner of the archived
members, and that the current <code class="code">umask</code> is compatible with original
permissions.</p>
