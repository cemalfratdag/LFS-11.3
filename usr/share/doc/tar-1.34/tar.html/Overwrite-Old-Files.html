<dd><p>Overwrite existing files and directory metadata when extracting files
from an archive.
</p>
<p>This causes <code class="command">tar</code> to write extracted files into the file system without
regard to the files already on the system; i.e., files with the same
names as archive members are overwritten when the archive is extracted.
It also causes <code class="command">tar</code> to extract the ownership, permissions,
and time stamps onto any preexisting files or directories.
If the name of a corresponding file name is a symbolic link, the file
pointed to by the symbolic link will be overwritten instead of the
symbolic link itself (if this is possible).  Moreover, special devices,
empty directories and even symbolic links are automatically removed if
they are in the way of extraction.
</p>
<p>Be careful when using the <samp class="option">--overwrite</samp> option, particularly when
combined with the <samp class="option">--absolute-names</samp> (<samp class="option">-P</samp>) option, as this combination
can change the contents, ownership or permissions of any file on your
system.  Also, many systems do not take kindly to overwriting files that
are currently being executed.
