<p>You have now seen how to use all eight of the operations available to
<code class="command">tar</code>, and a number of the possible options.  The next chapter
explains how to choose and change file and archive names, how to use
files to store names of other files which you can then call as
arguments to <code class="command">tar</code> (this can help you save time if you expect to
archive the same list of files a number of times), and so forth.
</p>

<p>If there are too many files to conveniently list on the command line,
you can list the names in a file, and <code class="command">tar</code> will read that file.
See <a class="xref" href="files.html">Reading Names from a File</a>.
</p>
<p>There are various ways of causing <code class="command">tar</code> to skip over some files,
and not archive them.  See <a class="xref" href="Choosing.html">Choosing Files and Names for <code class="command">tar</code></a>.
