<h4 class="subsection" id="Radix-to-Binary-1">15.6.2 Radix to Binary</h4>

<p><strong class="strong">This section needs to be rewritten, it currently describes the
algorithms used before GMP 4.3.</strong>
</p>
<p>Conversions from a power-of-2 radix into binary use a simple and fast
<em class="math">O(N)</em> bitwise concatenation algorithm.
</p>
<p>Conversions from other radices use one of two algorithms.  Sizes below
<code class="code">SET_STR_PRECOMPUTE_THRESHOLD</code> use a basic <em class="math">O(N^2)</em> method.  Groups
of <em class="math">n</em> digits are converted to limbs, where <em class="math">n</em> is the biggest
power of the base <em class="math">b</em> which will fit in a limb, then those groups are
accumulated into the result by multiplying by <em class="math">b^n</em> and adding.  This
saves multi-precision operations, as per Knuth section 4.4 part E
(see <a class="pxref" href="References.html">References</a>).  Some special case code is provided for decimal, giving
the compiler a chance to optimize multiplications by 10.
</p>
<p>Above <code class="code">SET_STR_PRECOMPUTE_THRESHOLD</code> a sub-quadratic algorithm is used.
First groups of <em class="math">n</em> digits are converted into limbs.  Then adjacent
limbs are combined into limb pairs with <em class="math">x*b^n+y</em>, where <em class="math">x</em>
and <em class="math">y</em> are the limbs.  Adjacent limb pairs are combined into quads
similarly with <em class="math">x*b^(2n)+y</em>.  This continues until a single block
remains, that being the result.
</p>
<p>The advantage of this method is that the multiplications for each <em class="math">x</em> are
big blocks, allowing Karatsuba and higher algorithms to be used.  But the cost
of calculating the powers <em class="math">b^(n*2^i)</em> must be overcome.
<code class="code">SET_STR_PRECOMPUTE_THRESHOLD</code> usually ends up quite big, around 5000 digits, and on
some processors much bigger still.
</p>
<p><code class="code">SET_STR_PRECOMPUTE_THRESHOLD</code> is based on the input digits (and tuned
for decimal), though it might be better based on a limb count, so as to be
independent of the base.  But that sort of count isn&rsquo;t used by the base case
and so would need some sort of initial calculation or estimate.
</p>
<p>The main reason <code class="code">SET_STR_PRECOMPUTE_THRESHOLD</code> is so much bigger than the
corresponding <code class="code">GET_STR_PRECOMPUTE_THRESHOLD</code> is that <code class="code">mpn_mul_1</code> is
much faster than <code class="code">mpn_divrem_1</code> (often by a factor of 5, or more).
