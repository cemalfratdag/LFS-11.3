<h4 class="subsection" id="Divide-and-Conquer-Division-1">15.2.3 Divide and Conquer Division</h4>

<p>For divisors larger than <code class="code">DC_DIV_QR_THRESHOLD</code>, division is done by dividing.
Or to be precise by a recursive divide and conquer algorithm based on work by
Moenck and Borodin, Jebelean, and Burnikel and Ziegler (see <a class="pxref" href="References.html">References</a>).
</p>
<p>The algorithm consists essentially of recognising that a 2NxN division
can be done with the basecase division algorithm (see <a class="pxref" href="Basecase-Division.html">Basecase Division</a>),
but using N/2 limbs as a base, not just a single limb.  This way the
multiplications that arise are (N/2)x(N/2) and can take advantage of
Karatsuba and higher multiplication algorithms (see <a class="pxref" href="Multiplication-Algorithms.html">Multiplication</a>).  The two &ldquo;digits&rdquo; of the quotient are formed by recursive
Nx(N/2) divisions.
</p>
<p>If the (N/2)x(N/2) multiplies are done with a basecase multiplication
then the work is about the same as a basecase division, but with more function
call overheads and with some subtractions separated from the multiplies.
These overheads mean that it&rsquo;s only when N/2 is above
<code class="code">MUL_TOOM22_THRESHOLD</code> that divide and conquer is of use.
</p>
<p><code class="code">DC_DIV_QR_THRESHOLD</code> is based on the divisor size N, so it will be somewhere
above twice <code class="code">MUL_TOOM22_THRESHOLD</code>, but how much above depends on the
CPU.  An optimized <code class="code">mpn_mul_basecase</code> can lower <code class="code">DC_DIV_QR_THRESHOLD</code> a
little by offering a ready-made advantage over repeated <code class="code">mpn_submul_1</code>
calls.
</p>
<p>Divide and conquer is asymptotically <em class="math">O(M(N)*log(N))</em> where
<em class="math">M(N)</em> is the time for an NxN multiplication done with FFTs.  The
actual time is a sum over multiplications of the recursed sizes, as can be
seen near the end of section 2.2 of Burnikel and Ziegler.  For example, within
the Toom-3 range, divide and conquer is <em class="math">2.63*M(N)</em>.  With higher
algorithms the <em class="math">M(N)</em> term improves and the multiplier tends to <em class="math">log(N)</em>.  In practice, at moderate to large sizes, a 2NxN division
is about 2 to 4 times slower than an NxN multiplication.
