<h4 class="subsection" id="Other-Multiplication-1">15.1.7 Other Multiplication</h4>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Toom-multiplication-3"></a>

<p>The Toom algorithms described above (see <a class="pxref" href="Toom-3_002dWay-Multiplication.html">Toom 3-Way Multiplication</a>,
see <a class="pxref" href="Toom-4_002dWay-Multiplication.html">Toom 4-Way Multiplication</a>) generalizes to split into an arbitrary
number of pieces, as per Knuth section 4.3.3 algorithm C.  This is not
currently used.  The notes here are merely for interest.
</p>
<p>In general a split into <em class="math">r+1</em> pieces is made, and evaluations and
pointwise multiplications done at <em class="math">2*r+1</em> points.  A 4-way split does 7
pointwise multiplies, 5-way does 9, etc.  Asymptotically an <em class="math">(r+1)</em>-way
algorithm is <em class="math">O(N^(log(2*r+1)/log(r+1)))</em>.  Only
the pointwise multiplications count towards big-<em class="math">O</em> complexity, but the
time spent in the evaluate and interpolate stages grows with <em class="math">r</em> and has
a significant practical impact, with the asymptotic advantage of each <em class="math">r</em>
realized only at bigger and bigger sizes.  The overheads grow as
<em class="math">O(N*r)</em>, whereas in an <em class="math">r=2^k</em> FFT they grow only as <em class="math">O(N*log(r))</em>.
</p>
<p>Knuth algorithm C evaluates at points 0,1,2,&hellip;,<em class="math">2*r</em>, but exercise 4
uses <em class="math">-r</em>,&hellip;,0,&hellip;,<em class="math">r</em> and the latter saves some small
multiplies in the evaluate stage (or rather trades them for additions), and
has a further saving of nearly half the interpolate steps.  The idea is to
separate odd and even final coefficients and then perform algorithm C steps C7
and C8 on them separately.  The divisors at step C7 become <em class="math">j^2</em> and the
multipliers at C8 become <em class="math">2*t*j-j^2</em>.
</p>
<p>Splitting odd and even parts through positive and negative points can be
thought of as using <em class="math">-1</em> as a square root of unity.  If a 4th root of
unity was available then a further split and speedup would be possible, but no
such root exists for plain integers.  Going to complex integers with
<em class="math">i=sqrt(-1)</em> doesn&rsquo;t help, essentially because in Cartesian
form it takes three real multiplies to do a complex multiply.  The existence
of <em class="math">2^k'</em>th roots of unity in a suitable ring or field lets the fast
Fourier transform keep splitting and get to <em class="math">O(N*log(r))</em>.
</p>
<p>Floating point FFTs use complex numbers approximating Nth roots of unity.
Some processors have special support for such FFTs.  But these are not used in
GMP since it&rsquo;s very difficult to guarantee an exact result (to some number of
bits).  An occasional difference of 1 in the last bit might not matter to a
typical signal processing algorithm, but is of course of vital importance to
GMP.
