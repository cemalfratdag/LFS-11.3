<h4 class="subsection" id="Carry-Propagation">15.8.3 Carry Propagation</h4>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Assembly-carry-propagation"></a>

<p>The problem that presents most challenges in GMP is propagating carries from
one limb to the next.  In functions like <code class="code">mpn_addmul_1</code> and
<code class="code">mpn_add_n</code>, carries are the only dependencies between limb operations.
</p>
<p>On processors with carry flags, a straightforward CISC style <code class="code">adc</code> is
generally best.  AMD K6 <code class="code">mpn_addmul_1</code> however is an example of an
unusual set of circumstances where a branch works out better.
</p>
<p>On RISC processors generally an add and compare for overflow is used.  This
sort of thing can be seen in <samp class="file">mpn/generic/aors_n.c</samp>.  Some carry
propagation schemes require 4 instructions, meaning at least 4 cycles per
limb, but other schemes may use just 1 or 2.  On wide superscalar processors
performance may be completely determined by the number of dependent
instructions between carry-in and carry-out for each limb.
</p>
<p>On vector processors good use can be made of the fact that a carry bit only
very rarely propagates more than one limb.  When adding a single bit to a
limb, there&rsquo;s only a carry out if that limb was <code class="code">0xFF&hellip;FF</code> which on
random data will be only 1 in <em class="math">2^mp_bits_per_limb</em>.  <samp class="file">mpn/cray/add_n.c</samp> is an example of this, it adds
all limbs in parallel, adds one set of carry bits in parallel and then only
rarely needs to fall through to a loop propagating further carries.
</p>
<p>On the x86s, GCC (as of version 2.95.2) doesn&rsquo;t generate particularly good code
for the RISC style idioms that are necessary to handle carry bits in
C.  Often conditional jumps are generated where <code class="code">adc</code> or <code class="code">sbb</code> forms
would be better.  And so unfortunately almost any loop involving carry bits
needs to be coded in assembly for best results.
