<p>Software pipelining consists of scheduling instructions around the branch
point in a loop.  For example a loop might issue a load not for use in the
present iteration but the next, thereby allowing extra cycles for the data to
arrive from memory.
</p>
<p>Naturally this is wanted only when doing things like loads or multiplies that
take several cycles to complete, and only where a CPU has multiple functional
units so that other work can be done in the meantime.
</p>
<p>A pipeline with several stages will have a data value in progress at each
stage and each loop iteration moves them along one stage.  This is like
juggling.
</p>
<p>If the latency of some instruction is greater than the loop time then it will
be necessary to unroll, so one register has a result ready to use while
another (or multiple others) are still in progress.  (see <a class="pxref" href="Assembly-Loop-Unrolling.html">Loop Unrolling</a>).
