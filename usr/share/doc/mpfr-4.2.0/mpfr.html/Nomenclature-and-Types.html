<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Floating_002dpoint-number"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Regular-number"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-mpfr_005ft"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-mpfr_005fptr"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-mpfr_005fsrcptr"></a>
<p>A <em class="dfn">floating-point number</em>, or <em class="dfn">float</em> for short, is an object
representing a radix-2 floating-point number consisting of a sign,
an arbitrary-precision normalized significand (also called mantissa),
and an exponent (an integer in some given range); these are called
<em class="dfn">regular numbers</em>. By convention, the radix point of the significand
is just before the first digit (which is always 1 due to normalization),
like in the C language, but unlike in IEEE 754 (thus, for a given
number, the exponent values in MPFR and in IEEE 754 differ by 1).
</p>
<p>Like in the IEEE 754 standard, a floating-point number can also
have three kinds of special values: a signed zero (+0 or −0),
a signed infinity (+Inf or −Inf), and Not-a-Number (NaN). NaN
can represent the default value of a floating-point object and the
result of some operations for which no other results would make sense,
such as 0 divided by 0 or +Inf minus +Inf; unless
documented otherwise, the sign bit of a NaN is unspecified.
Note that contrary to IEEE 754, MPFR has a single kind of NaN and
does not have subnormals.
Other than that, the behavior is very similar to IEEE 754, but there
are some minor differences.
</p>
<p>The C data type for such objects is <code class="code">mpfr_t</code>, internally defined
as a one-element array of a structure (so that when passed as an
argument to a function, it is the pointer that is actually passed),
and <code class="code">mpfr_ptr</code> is the C data type representing a pointer to this
structure; <code class="code">mpfr_srcptr</code> is like <code class="code">mpfr_ptr</code>, but the structure
is read-only (i.e., const qualified).
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Precision"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-mpfr_005fprec_005ft"></a>
<p>The <em class="dfn">precision</em> is the number of bits used to represent the significand
of a floating-point number;
the corresponding C data type is <code class="code">mpfr_prec_t</code>.
The precision can be any integer between <code class="code">MPFR_PREC_MIN</code> and
<code class="code">MPFR_PREC_MAX</code>. In the current implementation, <code class="code">MPFR_PREC_MIN</code>
is equal to 1.
</p>
<p>Warning! MPFR needs to increase the precision internally, in order to
provide accurate results (and in particular, correct rounding). Do not
attempt to set the precision to any value near <code class="code">MPFR_PREC_MAX</code>,
otherwise MPFR will abort due to an assertion failure. However, in practice,
the real limitation will probably be the available memory on your platform,
and in case of lack of memory, the program may abort, crash or have
undefined behavior (depending on your C implementation).
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Exponent"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-mpfr_005fexp_005ft"></a>
<p>An <em class="dfn">exponent</em> is a component of a regular floating-point number.
Its C data type is <code class="code">mpfr_exp_t</code>. Valid exponents are restricted
to a subset of this type, and the exponent range can be changed globally
as described in <a class="ref" href="Exception-Related-Functions.html">Exception Related Functions</a>. Special values do not
have an exponent.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Rounding"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-mpfr_005frnd_005ft"></a>
<p>The <em class="dfn">rounding mode</em> specifies the way to round the result of a
floating-point operation, in case the exact result cannot be represented
exactly in the destination (see <a class="pxref" href="Rounding.html">Rounding</a>).
The corresponding C data type is <code class="code">mpfr_rnd_t</code>.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Group-of-flags"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-mpfr_005fflags_005ft"></a>
<p>MPFR has a global (or per-thread) flag for each supported exception and
provides operations on flags (<a class="ref" href="Exceptions.html">Exceptions</a>). This C data type is used
to represent a group of flags (or a mask).
