<h2 class="chapter" id="Introduction-to-MPFR-1">1 Introduction to MPFR</h2>

<p>MPFR is a portable library written in C for arbitrary precision arithmetic
on floating-point numbers. It is based on the GNU MP library.
It aims to provide a class of floating-point numbers with
precise semantics. The main characteristics of MPFR, which make it differ
from most arbitrary precision floating-point software tools, are:
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>the MPFR code is portable, i.e., the result of any operation
does not depend on the machine word size
<code class="code">mp_bits_per_limb</code> (64 on most current processors), possibly
except in faithful rounding.
It does not depend either on the machine rounding mode or rounding precision;

</li><li>the precision in bits can be set <em class="emph">exactly</em> to any valid value
for each variable (including very small precision);

</li><li>MPFR provides the four rounding modes from the IEEE 754-1985
standard, plus away-from-zero, as well as for basic operations as for other
mathematical functions. Faithful rounding (partially supported) is provided
too, but the results may no longer be reproducible.

</li></ul>

<p>In particular, MPFR follows the specification of the IEEE 754 standard,
currently IEEE 754-2019 (which will be referred to as IEEE 754
in this manual), with some minor differences, such as: there is a single
NaN, the default exponent range is much wider, and subnormal numbers are
not implemented (but the exponent range can be reduced to any interval,
and subnormals can be emulated). For instance, computations in the
binary64 format (a.k.a. double precision) can be reproduced by using
a precision of 53 bits.
</p>
<p>This version of MPFR is released under the GNU Lesser General Public
License, version 3 or any later version.
It is permitted to link MPFR to most non-free programs, as long as when
distributing them the MPFR source code and a means to re-link with a
modified MPFR library is provided.

<p>Everyone should read <a class="ref" href="MPFR-Basics.html">MPFR Basics</a>.  If you need to install the library
yourself, you need to read <a class="ref" href="Installing-MPFR.html">Installing MPFR</a>, too.
To use the library you will need to refer to <a class="ref" href="MPFR-Interface.html">MPFR Interface</a>.
</p>
<p>The rest of the manual can be used for later reference, although it is
probably a good idea to glance through it.
