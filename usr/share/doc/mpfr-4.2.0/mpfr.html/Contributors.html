<h2 class="unnumbered" id="Contributors-1">Contributors</h2>

<p>The main developers of MPFR are Guillaume Hanrot, Vincent Lefèvre,
Patrick Pélissier, Philippe Théveny and Paul Zimmermann.
</p>
<p>Sylvie Boldo from ENS-Lyon, France,
contributed the functions <code class="code">mpfr_agm</code> and <code class="code">mpfr_log</code>.
Sylvain Chevillard contributed the <code class="code">mpfr_ai</code> function.
David Daney contributed the hyperbolic and inverse hyperbolic functions,
the base-2 exponential, and the factorial function.
Alain Delplanque contributed the new version of the <code class="code">mpfr_get_str</code>
function.
Mathieu Dutour contributed the functions <code class="code">mpfr_acos</code>, <code class="code">mpfr_asin</code>
and <code class="code">mpfr_atan</code>, and a previous version of <code class="code">mpfr_gamma</code>.
Laurent Fousse contributed the original version of the <code class="code">mpfr_sum</code>
function (used up to MPFR 3.1).
Emmanuel Jeandel, from ENS-Lyon too,
contributed the generic hypergeometric code,
as well as the internal function <code class="code">mpfr_exp3</code>,
a first implementation of the sine and cosine,
and improved versions of
<code class="code">mpfr_const_log2</code> and <code class="code">mpfr_const_pi</code>.
Ludovic Meunier helped in the design of the <code class="code">mpfr_erf</code> code.
Jean-Luc Rémy contributed the <code class="code">mpfr_zeta</code> code.
Fabrice Rouillier contributed the <code class="code">mpfr_xxx_z</code> and <code class="code">mpfr_xxx_q</code>
functions, and helped to the Microsoft Windows porting.
Damien Stehlé contributed the <code class="code">mpfr_get_ld_2exp</code> function.
Charles Karney contributed the <code class="code">mpfr_nrandom</code> and <code class="code">mpfr_erandom</code>
functions.
</p>
<p>We would like to thank Jean-Michel Muller and Joris van der Hoeven for very
fruitful discussions at the beginning of that project, Torbjörn Granlund
and Kevin Ryde for their help about design issues,
and Nathalie Revol for her careful reading of a previous version of
this documentation. In particular
Kevin Ryde did a tremendous job for the portability of MPFR in 2002-2004.
</p>
<p>The development of the MPFR library would not have been possible without
the continuous support of INRIA, and of the LORIA (Nancy, France) and LIP
(Lyon, France) laboratories. In particular the main authors were or are
members of the PolKA, Spaces, Cacao, Caramel and Caramba
project-teams at LORIA and of the
Arénaire and AriC project-teams at LIP.
This project was started during the Fiable (reliable in French) action
supported by INRIA, and continued during the AOC action.
The development of MPFR was also supported by a grant
(202F0659 00 MPN 121) from the Conseil Régional de Lorraine in 2002,
from INRIA by an &quot;associate engineer&quot; grant (2003-2005),
an &quot;opération de développement logiciel&quot; grant (2007-2009),
and the post-doctoral grant of Sylvain Chevillard in 2009-2010.
The MPFR-MPC workshop in June 2012 was partly supported by the ERC
grant ANTICS of Andreas Enge.
The MPFR-MPC workshop in January 2013 was partly supported by the ERC
grant ANTICS, the GDR IM and the Caramel project-team, during which
Mickaël Gastineau contributed the MPFRbench program,
Fredrik Johansson a faster version of <code class="code">mpfr_const_euler</code>,
and Jianyang Pan a formally proven version of the <code class="code">mpfr_add1sp1</code>
internal routine.
