<h2 class="chapter" id="API-Compatibility-1">6 API Compatibility</h2>

<p>The goal of this section is to describe some API changes that occurred
from one version of MPFR to another, and how to write code that can be compiled
and run with older MPFR versions.  The minimum MPFR version that is
considered here is 2.2.0 (released on 20 September 2005).
</p>
<p>API changes can only occur between major or minor versions.  Thus the
patchlevel (the third number in the MPFR version) will be ignored in
the following.  If a program does not use MPFR internals, changes in
the behavior between two versions differing only by the patchlevel
should only result from what was regarded as a bug or unspecified behavior.
</p>
<p>As a general rule, a program written for some MPFR version should work
with later versions, possibly except at a new major version, where
some features (described as obsolete for some time) can be removed.
In such a case, a failure should occur during compilation or linking.
If a result becomes incorrect because of such a change, please look
at the various changes below (they are minimal, and most software
should be unaffected), at the FAQ and at the MPFR web page for your
version (a bug could have been introduced and be already fixed);
and if the problem is not mentioned, please send us a bug report
(see <a class="pxref" href="Reporting-Bugs.html">Reporting Bugs</a>).
</p>
<p>However, a program written for the current MPFR version (as documented
by this manual) may not necessarily work with previous versions of
MPFR.  This section should help developers to write portable code.
</p>
<p>Note: Information given here may be incomplete.  API changes are
also described in the NEWS file (for each version, instead of being
classified like here), together with other changes.
