<h3 class="section" id="Floating_002dPoint-Values-on-Special-Numbers-1">4.5 Floating-Point Values on Special Numbers</h3>

<p>This section specifies the floating-point values (of type <code class="code">mpfr_t</code>)
returned by MPFR functions (where by “returned” we mean here the modified
value of the destination object, which should not be mixed with the ternary
return value of type <code class="code">int</code> of those functions).
For functions returning several values (like
<code class="code">mpfr_sin_cos</code>), the rules apply to each result separately.
</p>
<p>Functions can have one or several input arguments. An input point is
a mapping from these input arguments to the set of the MPFR numbers.
When none of its components are NaN, an input point can also be seen
as a tuple in the extended real numbers (the set of the real numbers
with both infinities).
</p>
<p>When the input point is in the domain of the mathematical function, the
result is rounded as described in <a class="ref" href="Rounding.html">Rounding</a> (but see
below for the specification of the sign of an exact zero). Otherwise
the general rules from this section apply unless stated otherwise in
the description of the MPFR function (<a class="ref" href="MPFR-Interface.html">MPFR Interface</a>).
</p>
<p>When the input point is not in the domain of the mathematical function
but is in its closure in the extended real numbers and the function can
be extended by continuity, the result is the obtained limit.
Examples: <code class="code">mpfr_hypot</code> on (+Inf,0) gives +Inf. But
<code class="code">mpfr_pow</code> cannot be defined on (1,+Inf) using this rule, as
one can find sequences (<var class="var">x</var>_<var class="var">n</var>,<var class="var">y</var>_<var class="var">n</var>)
such that <var class="var">x</var>_<var class="var">n</var> goes to 1, <var class="var">y</var>_<var class="var">n</var> goes
to +Inf and <var class="var">x</var>_<var class="var">n</var> to the <var class="var">y</var>_<var class="var">n</var>
goes to any positive value when <var class="var">n</var> goes to the infinity.
</p>
<p>When the input point is in the closure of the domain of the mathematical
function and an input argument is +0 (resp. −0), one considers
the limit when the corresponding argument approaches 0 from above
(resp. below), if possible. If the limit is not defined (e.g.,
<code class="code">mpfr_sqrt</code> and <code class="code">mpfr_log</code> on −0), the behavior is
specified in the description of the MPFR function, but must be consistent
with the rule from the above paragraph (e.g., <code class="code">mpfr_log</code> on ±0
gives −Inf).
</p>
<p>When the result is equal to 0, its sign is determined by considering the
limit as if the input point were not in the domain: If one approaches 0
from above (resp. below), the result is +0 (resp. −0);
for example, <code class="code">mpfr_sin</code> on −0 gives −0 and
<code class="code">mpfr_acos</code> on 1 gives +0 (in all rounding modes).
In the other cases, the sign is specified in the description of the MPFR
function; for example <code class="code">mpfr_max</code> on −0 and +0 gives +0.
</p>
<p>When the input point is not in the closure of the domain of the function,
the result is NaN. Example: <code class="code">mpfr_sqrt</code> on −17 gives NaN.
</p>
<p>When an input argument is NaN, the result is NaN, possibly except when
a partial function is constant on the finite floating-point numbers;
such a case is always explicitly specified in <a class="ref" href="MPFR-Interface.html">MPFR Interface</a>.
Example: <code class="code">mpfr_hypot</code> on (NaN,0) gives NaN, but <code class="code">mpfr_hypot</code>
on (NaN,+Inf) gives +Inf (as specified in
<a class="ref" href="Transcendental-Functions.html">Transcendental Functions</a>), since for any finite or infinite
input <var class="var">x</var>, <code class="code">mpfr_hypot</code> on (<var class="var">x</var>,+Inf) gives +Inf.
</p>
<p>MPFR also tries to follow the specifications of the IEEE 754 standard
on special values (IEEE 754 agree with the above rules in most cases).
Any difference with IEEE 754 that is not explicitly mentioned, other
than those due to the single NaN, is unintended and might be regarded as a
bug. See also <a class="ref" href="MPFR-and-the-IEEE-754-Standard.html">MPFR and the IEEE 754 Standard</a>.
